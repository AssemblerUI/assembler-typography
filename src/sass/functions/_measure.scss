 * @TODO: need to figure out an actual algorithm for this
 *
 * when reading Mark Boulton, he mentioned that 1em of a 16px font should
 * equal 16px, but when looking into that it didn't work.  This would make
 * measure a lot easier because 52 characters would be 52rem then. This might be
 * as a result to me setting the font to 100% since Jason Pamental's talk
 * mentioned not messing with the base font size since browsers optimize their
 * fonts for that specific size (makes sense), so that when you adjust to
 * different devices 100% will always look good and so you should never have to
 * adjust that size.
