<p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

<p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
<p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. All right.

<p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Red Five standing by. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>
<p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. What!? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</p>
