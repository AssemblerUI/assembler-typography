<h1>Revenge of the Sith</h1>
<p>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? What?!</p>
<h2>A New Hope</h2>
<p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
<h3>Jedi Academy</h3>
<p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. What!? Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
<h4>Return of the Jedi</h4>
<p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
<h5>The Battle for Endor</h5>
<p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? I'm trying not to, kid. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Ye-ha! You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</p>
